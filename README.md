## Project Overview
This project implements a complete **AI-driven data architecture** for FlexiMart, an e-commerce company. It covers the full pipeline from raw CSV ingestion to advanced analytics, including:

- **Part 1:** ETL pipeline, relational database schema, and business queries.  
- **Part 2:** NoSQL analysis and MongoDB implementation.  
- **Part 3:** Data warehouse design, star schema implementation, and OLAP queries.  

The project demonstrates how to handle messy real-world data, design normalized schemas, leverage NoSQL for flexibility, and build a dimensional warehouse for analytics.
